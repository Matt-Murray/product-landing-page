# Product Landing Page

This is the home web page for a fictional product. It was written in HTML and CSS as part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum. It features a functioning nav bar and utilizes CSS Flexbox.

## Reflection

This project was my first attempt at a modern, realistic webpage. I was able to experiment with different flexbox properties as well as layering multiple backgrounds and a fixed header with a navigation bar.
